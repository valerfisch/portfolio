# I'm Valérie

![alt](/blob_about.png)

\- a machine learning specialist and full-stack developer. With my background in software engineering, web-based 2D and 3D applications, and AI research, I’ve spent the last decade turning complex challenges into elegant digital solutions.

Currently completing my Master's in Informatics with a focus on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I'm applying my expertise to develop AI-based surrogate models for automotive simulations. Prior to this, I spent eight years designing and implementing cross-platform solutions for educational technology.
My technical toolkit includes multiple programming languages, deep learning architectures, and data science methodologies. I have particular expertise in 3D geometry applications, computer vision, and generative AI architectures.

> "I'm a AI & full-stack developer with a passion for computer vision, 3D geometry, and generative AI. I combine technical depth with creative curiosity - always exploring where code meets creativity."

Beyond my professional work, I'm an avid maker and creator. You might find me building and testing experimental FPV drones, reconstructing digital landscapes from drone footage, drafting sewing patterns, or preparing authentic Asian and Bavarian dishes. I also organize an international illustration meetup, connecting creative minds across borders.
