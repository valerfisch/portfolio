At Frisch & Veg, a gastronomy business, I provided long-term IT consulting and technical support tailored to the needs of a growing small enterprise. My work spanned from hardware acquisition and setup to the development of custom social media strategies that reflected the brandâ€™s identity and outreach goals. I implemented software-supported process optimizations to streamline daily operations and increase efficiency. Additionally, I consulted for e-commerce solutions and offered web hosting, helping the business build a stable and effective digital presence.

This experience taught me the importance of creating custom, resource-efficient solutions - especially when working within the tight constraints typical of small businesses. I learned how to identify real operational needs, prioritize impact over complexity, and deliver practical systems that truly support day-to-day work. Supporting Frisch & Veg gave me a lasting appreciation for helping smaller teams thrive with smart, cost-effective technology, a perspective that continues to shape how I approach technical challenges today.
