I earned my B.Sc. in Informatics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), one of Europe’s top technical universities. The program provided a rigorous foundation in computer science and mathematics, covering key areas such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, databases, and software architecture. Mathematically, it trained me in linear algebra, discrete mathematics, calculus, and probability — all essential for understanding computational complexity, graphics pipelines, and later, machine learning.

My thesis focused on interactive 3D applications as progressive web apps, where I applied real-time rendering techniques and modern web technologies to evaluate platform-independent, browser-based 3D experiences.

This degree not only sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills but also shaped how I approach software design — balancing theoretical soundness with practical usability. It laid a solid foundation for my work in full-stack development, human-computer interaction, and ML-based systems.
