At GANT, I was responsible for selling clothing and assisting customers on the sales floor. My focus was on providing friendly, attentive service to ensure a positive shopping experience and build customer loyalty. This included answering questions, offering styling advice, and maintaining a clean, organized retail space—all with an emphasis on customer satisfaction and brand representation.

This early experience in retail taught me the value of clear communication, empathy, and brand consistency - lessons that strongly shaped my approach in later technical roles. It instilled a desire to build software that reflects strong brand values and to support users through intuitive, thoughtful design. Whether developing educational platforms or technical tools, I carry forward the same focus: understanding user needs, earning trust, and delivering experiences that feel both purposeful and human.
