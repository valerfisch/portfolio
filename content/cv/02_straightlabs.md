During my eight years at straightlabs, an EdTech company specializing in immersive digital learning tools, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on UI/UX design and development. While I contributed across the full stack, my primary goal was always to translate complex technical features into clear, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces that enhanced learning experiences.

I was responsible for designing and implementing responsive front-end applications using modern frameworks such as Tailwind, Angular, Vue, and Ionic. My focus was on creating educational tools that were not only functional, but also intuitive and engaging - ensuring users could interact with powerful features effortlessly.

Although I supported backend development with technologies like Kotlin, Java, SQL, and Golang, and contributed to CI/CD pipelines and system architecture, my greatest impact was in bridging the gap between complex system logic and user-centered design.

This emphasis on thoughtful UI/UX contributed directly to several award-winning projects. As lead UI designer for the Brand Behaviour Companion, a 3D web training platform developed for BMW Group, I helped the product earn the Red Dot Design Award in both 2021 and 2022. The project was based on the core technology I explored in my Bachelor thesis, “Interactive 3D Applications as Progressive Web Apps,” which enabled real-time 3D integration into cross-platform browser environments.

I also served as the UI/UX developer for the Allianz Virtuelle Lernwelt, a personalized learning environment that won the eLearning Award in 2020. In both cases, the user experience was central to the product’s success, and my role focused on ensuring that functionality and usability were always aligned.

These experiences shaped my philosophy as a developer: to build systems where technical depth is matched by a clear and intuitive user interface, making powerful tools approachable and meaningful for every user.

Beyond individual features and UI iterations, I played a long-term role in supporting, maintaining, and evolving complex EdTech products over several years. This sustained involvement gave me a deep understanding of each product’s technical architecture and lifecycle—from initial concept and MVP to iterative scaling and deployment. I developed a strong awareness of how decisions around component structure, data flow, and system integration affect long-term usability, maintainability, and performance. By balancing visual clarity with architectural soundness, I ensured that user-facing features were not only easy to use, but also robust, efficient, and scalable. This long-term perspective allowed me to act as a bridge between design goals and engineering realities, helping teams deliver software that endures.
