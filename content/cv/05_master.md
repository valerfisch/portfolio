I’m currently completing my M.Sc. in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), with a focus on Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision. The program deepens my understanding of intelligent systems and data-driven technologies, combining rigorous theoretical coursework with hands-on research and applied projects.

Throughout my studies, I’ve explored advanced machine learning architectures — from generative models and transformers to 3D geometry processing and video object segmentation. I've also gained experience working with real-world datasets, building scalable pipelines, and training and evaluating deep neural networks.

As the culmination of this program, my master’s thesis at BMW Group focuses on AI-based surrogate models for simulating the behavior of mechanical systems, specifically exploring how deep learning can replace traditional physical simulations of auxiliary springs. This work bridges my expertise in 3D data, machine learning, and system design — and reflects my drive to create practical, intelligent tools for real-world engineering problems.
