During my studies in Games Engineering at TUM, I developed a deep technical understanding of 3D objects and interactive environments. The program combined core computer science with specialized courses in 3D graphics, game physics, and real-time rendering - providing hands-on experience with how digital objects are represented, manipulated, and rendered in virtual space.

Although I left the program after four semesters to pursue a broader path in informatics, this foundation was instrumental in shaping my later work in 3D machine learning, computer vision, and spatial data processing.
