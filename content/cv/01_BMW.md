At BMW Group, I conducted my Master's thesis at the research and innovation center, focusing on the application of AI-based surrogate modeling for simulating auxiliary spring behavior - a novel approach in vehicle dynamics simulation.

My work centered on the design, implementation, and evaluation of deep learning models to predict characteristic curves used in spring behavior simulation. I developed modular and scalable pipelines for data generation, model training, and inference, allowing efficient experimentation with a variety of architectures.

The models I explored included transformers, feedforward neural networks (NNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and encoder-decoder architectures. I implemented custom loss functions tailored to domain-specific requirements and evaluated model performance for accuracy, generalization, and simulation readiness.

In addition to experimentation, I was responsible for the deployment and integration of the final model into the existing simulation toolchain at BMW. This required adhering to established software standards, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems, and maintaining reproducibility and performance across different environments.

By aligning technical research with practical deployment constraints, I contributed a fully integrated, AI-enhanced solution that supports faster and more accurate simulation workflows during the early stages. This experience deepened my expertise in bridging theoretical ML work with real-world engineering tools, and in collaborating across disciplines to deliver production-ready innovation in the automotive sector.
