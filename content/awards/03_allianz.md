### Project Overview
The “Allianz Virtuelle Lernwelt” is an innovative, cloud-based mobile learning platform developed for Allianz Versicherungs AG to support the upskilling of over 3,000 employees in the claims department.
Designed as part of a strategic initiative to reinforce Allianz's position as a service market leader, the platform promotes lifelong, self-directed learning through engaging, personalized digital experiences.
The project won the eLearning AWARD 2020 in the category “Personal Learning Environment” for its pioneering approach to digital employee training.

### Challenge
Allianz aimed to transform traditional training into a scalable, digital-first learning ecosystem that enabled anytime, anywhere access through a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) approach. The platform was designed to deliver over 600 modular training units via an intuitive interface, encouraging voluntary engagement through gamification and personalized learning paths. It allowed non-technical staff to manage and update content dynamically, while robust analytics provided individualized feedback and compliance tracking. The project required careful balancing of user experience, pedagogical quality, and stringent data protection (DSGVO) standards, adding to its complexity.


### Solution
We built a mobile-first learning application with a user-centric interface, and built-in game mechanics such as quizzes, learning cards, competitions, and a progression-based mini-game (“Allianz Tower”).
To streamline content updates, we implemented a custom CMS that allowed training teams to manage all modules internally without developer involvement.
Robust analytics features enabled personalized learning plans and real-time progress tracking across individual and organizational levels.
