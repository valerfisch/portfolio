### Project Overview
The Brand Behaviour Companion is a comprehensive digital platform designed to provide BMW Group employees with essential brand behavior guidelines and strategic content.
The solution seamlessly delivers a consistent experience across smartphones, tablets, and desktops while maintaining the premium visual identity of both BMW and MINI brands.

### Challenge
BMW Group needed a secure, accessible tool to standardize brand behavior knowledge across their organization.
The platform needed to effectively communicate complex brand strategies, maintain high security standards, and engage employees through an intuitive user experience that reflected the prestigious nature of both BMW and MINI brands.

### Solution
We built a progressive web application that delivers multilingual brand strategy foundations and guidelines through an engaging, interactive experience. The platform includes gamified learning modules, regularly updated editorial content on brand evolution, and a visual timeline highlighting brand heritage—such as MINI’s journey from 1959 to today. Customer-focused sections address shifting consumer expectations, all presented within a clean, responsive design that reflects the distinct visual identities of both BMW and MINI.
