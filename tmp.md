__Machine Learning:__
I work with 3D geometry, generative models (GANs, VAEs, Transformers), and vision-based tasks like segmentation and scene reconstruction.

__Engineering:__
From scalable backend systems to responsive cross-platform UIs, I build robust applications using tools like Python, Golang, React, Docker, and Kubernetes.

__UX/UI Design:__
I design intuitive interfaces that have earned awards like the Red Dot Design Award for my work for the BMW Group

__Agile & DevOps:__
With experience in CI/CD, Jira, Git, and cloud-native environments, I streamline development workflows and ship fast.
